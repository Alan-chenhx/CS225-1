Bill's guards have already set up the N64 with Smash. You shake hands with the Microsoft CEO knowing full well the risk you have assumed. Within seconds it becomes apparent that Bill doesn't know what he's doing. It almost looks like he's never even played before. What a n00b. I guess playing Smash 8 hours per day instead of sleeping has finally paid off. Bill Gates is quickly defeated and sheds a tear before agreeing to fulfill his promise. In early 2000 he resigns as CEO of Microsoft and you set Apple on track to be the most valuable company in the world. Suck it Bill Gates. Apple forever!
