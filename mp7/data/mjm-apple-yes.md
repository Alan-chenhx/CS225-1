It's Black Friday. You fly to Alcatraz in a helicopter. You are overcome by roid rage and adrenaline. The day has finally come to settle the biggest rivalry in the tech market. You see Bill Gates and a swarm of armed guards surrounding him. However, he seems to be unarmed. Bill says: "WTF? Why do you look so aggressive? Did you think I wanted to fight you?" Apparently he wanted to challenge you to a round of Super Smash Bros instead. Loser resigns as CEO of their company. Of course you accept this offer given that you are a Smash Bros champion, even though the training went to waste.
