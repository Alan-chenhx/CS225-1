You decided to do what you usually do â€“ keep prices consistently high and advertise them relentlessly. However, Macs are starting to have problems with security. There are rumors that this is the doing of Microsoft, and the creation of these viruses may have even been a direct order from Bill Gates. How do you deal with this attack?
